2) Objects: Objects can be defined as instances of class having all the behaviours and values of the class.

Features of OOPs:
There are four major features of OOPs.

Inheritance: Mechanism by which an object or class is created using definition of other object or class. Improves code reusability.

Polymorphism: It means to behave differently in different conditions. 

Encapsulation: Process of binding data member and methods to do a job without revealing unnecessary information. (Data Binding + Data Hiding)

Abstraction: Mechanism by which only relevant details are shown. Other non-important components are hidden.
